# Homework Record
If I need to change the solidity contract, three steps are needed:
1. Change the solidity contract code and recompile it
2. Delete the ignition cache file manually
3. Deploy the solidity contract to the paseo asset hub again

Sometimes the deployment would fail, and I need to check the error message and rerun it.
